# Polyzero Electric Cables

Procedural electric cable generation for Unity pole chains.

This package lets you prepare a pole prefab with cable sockets, duplicate pole instances in a scene, and automatically generate procedural cable meshes between matching sockets. It includes wind animation, per-cable wind variation, LOD, bake/return-to-dynamic workflow, quality modes, profiles, validation, and local broken cable details near sockets.

## Quick Start

1. Open `Polyzero > Spline > Electric Cable Setup Wizard`.
2. Drag your pole prefab into `Pole Prefab`.
3. Choose how many cable sockets the pole should have.
4. Click through the wizard and press `Setup Prefab + Scene Chain`.
5. Open the pole prefab or first pole instance and move `CableSocket_01`, `CableSocket_02`, etc. to the correct attachment points.
6. Duplicate pole instances as direct children of the generated `PoleChain` object.
7. Select `PoleChain` and press `Rebuild Chain`.

The generator connects matching socket indices:

```text
Pole_01 CableSocket_01 -> Pole_02 CableSocket_01
Pole_01 CableSocket_02 -> Pole_02 CableSocket_02
Pole_01 CableSocket_03 -> Pole_02 CableSocket_03
```

## Recommended Hierarchy

```text
PoleChain
├── Pole_01
├── Pole_02
├── Pole_03
├── AutoCable_01_01
├── AutoCable_01_02
└── AutoCable_02_01
```

Poles must be direct children of the `PoleChain` object when using `Direct Children` discovery.

## Main Inspector Workflow

Select `PoleChain`. The custom inspector is split into:

- `Start`: validation, common fixes, profiles, quality mode, rebuild/clear.
- `Look`: cable width, sag, material, color and mesh quality.
- `Motion`: wind settings and per-cable variation.
- `Optimize`: bake, return to dynamic, LOD and profile application.
- `Damage`: local damage utilities and legacy long-cable broken tools.
- `Advanced`: discovery/material/raw settings.

Most users should only need `Start`, `Look`, `Motion`, and `Optimize`.

## Validate Setup

Use `Validate Setup` on the `PoleChain` inspector to check:

- whether poles are detected;
- whether each pole has an `ElectricPoleCableHub`;
- whether sockets exist and are not null;
- whether the generated material is valid for the current render pipeline;
- whether generated cables already exist.

Use `Fix Common Issues` to reset safe defaults, enable fallback material generation, apply settings to existing cables, and rebuild.

## Quality Modes

The generator includes four quality modes:

- `Mobile`: low segment counts and aggressive LOD.
- `Balanced`: good default for gameplay.
- `HighQuality`: better visual fidelity for close inspection.
- `Cinematic`: high segment counts for screenshots/trailers.

Use `Apply Quality + Rebuild` to apply the selected mode and rebuild the chain.

## Profiles

Open the `Start` tab and click `Create Default Profiles`.

This creates cable profile assets under:

```text
Assets/Game/Spline/Profiles
```

Default profiles include:

- `Thin_Power_Cable`
- `Thick_Power_Cable`
- `Loose_Old_Cable`
- `Telephone_Wire`

Use `Apply Profile + Rebuild` for the fastest workflow.

## Wind

Use the `Motion` tab on `PoleChain`.

Recommended settings:

```text
Enable Wind = true
Amount = 0.04
Speed = 3.32
Wave Length = 0.14
Vary Each Cable = true
```

Keep `Vary Each Cable` enabled so parallel cables do not move in the same phase.

## Bake / Return To Dynamic

Use `Optimize > Bake All Cables` to freeze cable topology/LOD. Baked cables can still keep wind if `Baked Keeps Wind` is enabled.

Use `Return To Dynamic` to restore full procedural rebuild behavior.

## Local Broken Cables

Long mid-span broken cables usually look unrealistic. The recommended workflow is local broken cables near the pole sockets.

Add or keep `ElectricPoleLocalBrokenCables` on the pole prefab. Presets:

- `None`
- `OneLooseWire`
- `TwoLooseWires`
- `HangingJumper`
- `MessyOldPole`

Use the `Damage` tab on `PoleChain` to randomize or clear local damage across poles.

## Troubleshooting

### Cables do not appear

Check that your pole instances are direct children of `PoleChain`, then press `Validate Setup` and `Rebuild Chain`.

### Cables connect in the wrong order

The child order under `PoleChain` controls connection order. Reorder pole instances in the hierarchy.

### Cable material is purple

Leave `Material` empty and enable `Auto Material If Empty` + `Replace Unsupported Material` in `Advanced`, then press `Fix Common Issues`.

### Wind looks too synchronized

Enable `Vary Each Cable` in the `Motion` tab and rebuild the chain.

### Baked cables do not move

Enable `Baked Keeps Wind`, then bake again or return to dynamic and bake again.

### Broken long cables look wrong

Avoid using broken mode on long `AutoCable` objects. Use local broken cable presets on the pole prefab instead.

## Render Pipeline Support

The generator attempts to create a compatible fallback material for:

- HDRP
- URP
- Built-in Render Pipeline

For best results, assign your own material made for the current render pipeline.

## Suggested Asset Store Package Layout

The project currently keeps scripts under `Assets/Game/Spline` for compatibility with the existing project. For a Store package, migrate to:

```text
Assets/Polyzero/ElectricCables/
├── Runtime
├── Editor
├── Profiles
├── Materials
├── Prefabs
├── Demo
└── Documentation
```

Move files using Unity's Project window so `.meta` files and references are preserved.
